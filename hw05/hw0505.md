However for local variable, it will be saved is stack segement of memery, and its size usually have been limited by the system.
Besides, we can use command```ulimit -a``` to check the upper limit. For instance, my virtual machine only accept 8192 KB(=8MB).
If I claim a local variable```char str[10000000];``` in my program. It's about 9.54 MB, and my system will warn segement fault and stop my program.
