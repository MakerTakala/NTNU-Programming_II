In manual, strerror is included in string.h
> char *strerror(int errnum);  

errnum is usually errno, strerror print the error message according to errnum, that is, we can change strerror output by input different number by myself.  

> e.g.  
strerror(13)  
output: "Permission denied"  

However, perror is include in stdio.h
> void perror(const char *s);  

perror print the error message by errno which is included by errno.h, s just can input a string before the error message.

> e.g. (assume error has become 13)  
perror("ERROR")  
output: "ERROR:Permission denied"
